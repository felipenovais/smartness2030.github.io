The SMARTNESS Engineering Research Center aims to advance cutting-edge research in computer networks and digital application services focused on strategic areas where scientific and technological impacts can be achieved towards the year 2030, in collaboration with communities of cloud search and networks. With the deployment of 5G and the 6G vision being developed, the main challenges for SMARTNESS are how to design and operate cloud computing infrastructures and networks with adequate capabilities to leverage the next generation of Internet services and applications. The scope of end-to-end services at the Internet scale is exceptionally broad and requires contributions across multiple disciplines along with large investments in capital and human resources. However, the ongoing vertical transformation in industries and the shift towards softwarization and disaggregation of infrastructures into multiple levels and layers of protocols has opened up a well-defined set of opportunities for accelerated innovation at unprecedented barriers to entry for partnership-based ventures. between academia and industry. Cloud computing and network infrastructures are increasingly becoming multidisciplinary, necessitating end-to-end system-oriented views that leverage advances in hardware (HW) for computing and networking, software architectures (SW) and business models, among other engineering disciplines (e.g. energy efficiency and safety planning). SMARTNESS aims to explore well-planned opportunities through an appropriate methodology based on the confluence of Research Strands (RS) designed to successfully impact world-class research and innovation to address challenging use cases. in Internet scenarios for industry and society with a vision horizon for the year 2030.</p>
